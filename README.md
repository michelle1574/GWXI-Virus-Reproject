#GWXI Virus - Reprojected
Welcome to the reprojected version of GWXI - a virus in Polish that I abandoned in 2021
and made a new one.
This virus is causing Windows to go to fallback state.
The app UI looks like this:

I know that this looks a little bit weird, unfortunanetly with my Visual Basic skills I coudln't

After clicking Get Ready - it will get disabled.
##Requirements
Latest version of Windows 10 (not insider)
Architecture x64
Administrator rights
And a lot of time.
